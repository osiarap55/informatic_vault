Good sofware tools should do the following things:
	- do one thing well
	- process lines of text, not binary
	- use regulare expresions
	- default to standard I/O (input/ouput)
	- don't be chatty :P
	- generate the same input format accepted as input
	- let someone do the hard part
	- detour to build specialized tools

#bash_script
