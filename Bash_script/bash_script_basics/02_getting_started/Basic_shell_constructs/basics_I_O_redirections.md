standards I/O inputs the most fundamental concept in sofware, the idea of programs should have a data source, a data sink(where data goes), and a place to report problems.

	1.- standard input -- data source

	3.- standard output -- data sink

	4.- standard error -- report problems.

when you login into your unix computer, your terminal became the place where all inputs, and output errors happend as the standard.

 * Most basic Idea of the *I/O redirection* is the process where you and the machine have an interaction, or from the shell script.

#### Example

```sh
âžœ  ~  cat              
now is the time									#input
now is the time									#output in the terminal
for all good men								#input
for all good men								#output 
to come to the aid of their countries
to come to the aid of their countries
^D
```
