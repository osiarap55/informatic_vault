## Commands and Arguments

The shell most basic job is simply to execute Commands, you type commands one at time, and the shell execute them:

```sh

### Shell Commands 

The shell recognizes three fundamenta kind of commands: built-in commands, sheel functions and external commands:

 * Built-in commands are just that: commands that the shell executes itself, such us *cd* or *read* to get input from the users, other commands are often built into the shell for efficiency

 * Shell functions are self-contained chunk of code, written in the shell languages that are invoked in the same way as command is.

 * External commands are the ones that the shell runs by creating a separe process. The basics steps are:

	* Create a new process. This process starts out as a copy of the shell.
	* In the new process, search the directories listed in the *PATH* varibale for the given command.
	* In the new process, execute the found program by replacing the running shell program with the new program.
	* When the program finishes, the original shell continues by reading the next command from the terminal, or by running the next command in the script.
