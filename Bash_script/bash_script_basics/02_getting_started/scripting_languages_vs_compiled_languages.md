## Compile languages vs scripting languages

### Compile language

Languages like **Fortran**, **Ada**, **Pascal**, **C**, **C++** or **Java**. Those programming languages are translated from the *original source code* into object code which is then executed directly by the computer hardware. 

The benefits of compile languages is that they are efficient, but its dificult write simple code with them. (for example in C++ to do something "copy all the directory to that directory over there"). 


### Scripting language

Scripting languages are usually interpreted. which means that that between the language and the machine(computer) there is an interpreted which do the translation for the computer.
