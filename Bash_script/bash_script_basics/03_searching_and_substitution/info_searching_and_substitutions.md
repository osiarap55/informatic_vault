Unix programmers prefer to work on lines of text. Textual data is more flexible than binary data, and Unix systems provide a number of tools that make slicing and dicing text easy.

### What is this chapter about?

we look to fundamentals operations that show up repeatedly in shell scripting:
	
	* **Text searching** - looking for specific lines of text

	* **Text substitution** - changing the text that is found.

As well **regular expresion**, regular expreions provide a much powerful notation for matching many different actual text fragments with a single expression.
