# Physical Security Controls

Physical security controls are the **first line of defense** in protecting infrastructure.  
They include physical barriers, locks, guards, and supporting policies to restrict and monitor access.

---

## Physical Barriers
- Reception desks, guards, locked doors, windows, and partitions can all act as **physical barriers**.  
- Visitors may need escorts to prevent unauthorized movement.  
- At night, a locked door can be augmented with **sensors and alarms**, linked locally or to law enforcement.

---

## Locks and Keys
- **Lockable doors** = the basic physical barrier.  
- **Keys** provide authentication (proof of access rights).  
- Types of locks:  
  - ðŸ”‘ Standard mechanical deadbolts (single/double cylinder).  
  - ðŸ”‘ Solenoid-operated deadbolts (electronically controlled).  
  - ðŸ”‘ Cipher locks (PIN code entry).  
- Keys can be **physical** or **logical** (e.g., smartcards).

## Key Control Policy
> **A strict key control policy** ensures equipment and information remain protected.  
- Keys should be numbered and coded.  
- Only select personnel should have access.  

---

## Security Guards
- Guards provide **judgment and adaptability** that devices cannot.  
- They act as deterrents, offer situational awareness, and can intervene in real time.  
- Even if more expensive, they are valuable complements to electronic access controls.  

---

## Supporting Technologies
- **RFID badges / smartcards**: allow access when near sensors.  
- **Electronic deadbolts**: controlled via access systems or intelligent cards.  
- **Cameras & alarms**: record evidence and alert of intrusions.
