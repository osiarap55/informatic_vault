# Access-Control Gates and Relays

## Access-Control Gates
Gates function as **physical barriers** similar to doors, controlling ingress and egress through walls or fences.  
They are commonly motorized and can be classified into:

- **Sliding Gates**  
  - Move horizontally on a track.  
  - Provide **high security** and are suited for areas like parking lots or large facilities.  
  - Often integrated with **loops and card readers** to control vehicle access.  

- **Swinging Gates**  
  - Rotate on adjustable hinges (up to 180°).  
  - Operated by motors, arms, or piston/cylinder mechanisms.  
  - Common for standard facility entries.

## Control Relays
Relays are **electromechanical devices** that allow low-voltage signals to control higher-voltage/current equipment.  
Used in:  
- Electric gates  
- Door locks  
- Garage door openers  
- Other remote security devices  

### Components
- **Coil**: when energized, creates a magnetic field.  
- **Armature**: moves in response to the magnetic field.  
- **Contacts**:  
  - Normally Open (NO)  
  - Normally Closed (NC)  
  - Common (C)  

### Relay Operation
- **No current applied** → default connection between Common and NC.  
- **Current applied** → coil energizes, switches to connect Common and NO.

## Fail-Safe vs Fail-Secure
- **Fail-Safe**: Unlocks when power is lost (ensures safety for exit).  
- **Fail-Secure**: Locks when power is lost (ensures protection).  
- Choice depends on the security requirement of the environment.

## Applications
- Integrated into **keypads, key fobs, and door lock systems**.  
- Allow automation and remote control of gates and barriers.  
- Provide **flexibility** for designing layered access control systems.
