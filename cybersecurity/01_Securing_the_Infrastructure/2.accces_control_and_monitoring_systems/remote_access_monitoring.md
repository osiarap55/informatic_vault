# Automated Access-Control and Remote Monitoring

## Automated Access-Control Systems
- Add an extra dimension to **standard security**, offering **monitoring and reporting functions**.  
- Two main types:  
  1. **Perimeter-access systems** → control entry at physical boundaries.  
  2. **Remote-access systems** → authenticate users from a different location than the entry point.  

### Remote Access
- Verifies identities at a distance using passwords, key cards, or codes.  
- Enables monitoring of gates, doors, lighting, and HVAC systems from remote sites.  
- Can integrate with CCTV for **visual verification**.

## Monitoring Functions
- **Opened/Closed Condition** → Detects whether doors or gates are open/closed.  
- **Locked/Unlocked Condition** → Confirms if a barrier is locked/unlocked.  
- **Condition Monitoring** → Records times, dates, and details of status changes.  
- **Time-of-Day Settings** → Grants or denies access based on schedules (e.g., deliveries only allowed during work hours).

## Sensors
- Magnetic or electronic sensors detect **barrier states** (open/closed, locked/unlocked).  
- Important: a single sensor may not distinguish between “closed” and “locked”; additional sensors may be required.  

---

## Remote-Access Monitoring
- Supervises security systems from a **remote location** via communication lines.  
- Detects and reports **unauthorized access attempts**.  
- Notifications can include:  
  - Visual alerts on a console.  
  - Phone calls or text messages.  
  - Instant messaging or automated sirens/lights.

## Key Takeaways
- Automated access systems enhance convenience and security.  
- Remote monitoring allows **real-time alerts and responses** to incidents.  
- Proper configuration of sensors and schedules ensures accurate reporting.  
- Integration with CCTV and alarms creates a comprehensive defense system.
