# Security Policies

Security policies are the **framework** that ties together all three levels of security:  
- Outer perimeter  
- Inner perimeter  
- Interior  

---

## Purpose
- Define **who is authorized** to access different assets.  
- Specify **what actions** are allowed once access is granted.  
- Reduce risk by preventing accidents, unauthorized access, and misuse of assets.

---

## Characteristics of a Good Policy
1. Clearly defines **roles and responsibilities**.  
2. Establishes **access levels** for different categories of users.  
3. Supports compliance with legal/regulatory requirements.  
4. Creates consistency across the organization.  

---

## Benefits
- Protects both **physical and cyber assets**.  
- Reduces risk of internal errors (e.g., an employee spilling coffee on a production server).  
- Balances usability and protection.  

---

## Key Takeaway
> A well-designed **security policy** is the glue that ensures all physical and logical security measures work together effectively.
