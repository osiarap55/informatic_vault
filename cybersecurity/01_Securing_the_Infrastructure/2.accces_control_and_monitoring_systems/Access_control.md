# Access Control

## Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED)
- CPTED = set of building/property design principles to **discourage intruders**.  
- Focuses on anticipating potential intrusion paths and **designing environments to reduce opportunities** for crime.  
- Examples: strategic parking layouts, landscaping that channels people, marked entry/exit points.  

---

## Inner Perimeter
- Involves **physical barriers**: walls, doors, windows.  
- Prevents intruders from moving from the outer perimeter into interior areas.  
- Can be part of the building’s external structure or internal partitions controlling access to specific work areas.  

---

## Interior Security
- **Innermost level of protection**.  
- Focus on **monitoring activity** inside the inner perimeter.  
- Relies on both **human security (guards)** and **electronic systems** (cameras, sensors).  
- Detects intruders, tracks movement, and records evidence of activities.  
- Combination of people + technology = stronger defense.

## Access Control — Core Idea
- The **first and most basic goal**: prevent intruders from reaching and damaging assets.  
- Works by controlling **what people can physically access**.  
- Shown in *Figure 2.2*: locks, fences, keypads, cards.

## Ingress / Egress / Regress
- **Ingress** → the legal right to enter.  
- **Egress** → the legal right to exit.  
- **Regress** → the legal right to re-enter.  

These terms define movement in/out of secure spaces.

---

## Authorization and Rights
- **Right** = privilege/permission granted by an authority (e.g., government, company, asset owner).  
- **Authorized person** = recognized by authority to access.  
- **Unauthorized person** = lacks rights; attempts = **intrusion**.  


---

## Outer Perimeter (revisited)
- Access control **begins here**.  
- Examples: property line, building entrance.  
- Goal: control who can walk/drive across.  
- Measures: fences, hedges, warning signs, or clear visual boundaries.  

---

## Key Takeaways
- Access control is about **managing entry and exit** based on authorization.  
- Layered approach (outer → inner → interior).  
- CPTED principles help **design spaces to discourage intrusions**.  
- Combining **policies, people, and technology** builds effective protection.
