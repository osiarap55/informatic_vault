# A Quick Primer on infrastructure security

## Main Objective
The goal of infrastructure security is to establish a **peace-of-mind condition** for individuals, groups, or organizations.  
This is achieved through:
- Exclusive rights to access assets (objects, information).  
- Controlled use of those assets.  
- Ensuring value and confidence for asset owners.

## Modern Definition of Security
- **Physical security:** the science and practice of protecting tangible assets â†’ preventing theft, physical damage, unauthorized access, and disclosure.  
- **Cybersecurity:** focuses on protecting intangible assets â†’ electronic, optical, and informational access to systems and data.  
- Both domains must work together in synergy to form effective **infrastructure security**.

## Access Control Methods
1. **Natural Access Control:**  
   Use of natural or structural elements (landscaping, building design) to guide people entering and leaving spaces.  

2. **Territorial Reinforcement:**  
   Use of structures and devices to differentiate public vs. private, prevent unauthorized entry, and reinforce security.

## Core Subsystems
Infrastructure security relies on three main subsystems:
- ðŸ”¹ **Access-control and monitoring systems**  
- ðŸ”¹ **Video surveillance systems**  
- ðŸ”¹ **Intrusion-detection and reporting systems**

## The Three Perimeters
1. **Outer Perimeter:**  
   - Legal or physical boundary (fences, walls, property lines).  
   - Controls who can cross into the property or facility.  

2. **Inner Perimeter:**  
   - Physical barriers within the outer perimeter (doors, walls, windows).  
   - Provides additional layers of protection.  

3. **Interior:**  
   - The innermost security layer.  
   - Protects offices, cubicles, and spaces containing the most critical assets.

## Securing Logical Perimeters
Besides physical protection, organizations must also secure **logical perimeters**:  
- Computing and control systems, networks, and Internet access.  
- The same security principles (perimeters, access, monitoring) apply in logical domains as in physical ones.
