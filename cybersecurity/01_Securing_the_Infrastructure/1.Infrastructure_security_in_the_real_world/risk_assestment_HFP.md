- Create an inventory of cyber assets (software platforms and applications) within the organization (NIST ID.AM-2).  
- Prioritize the organization’s assets based on their criticality or value to the business functions of the organization (NIST ID.BE-3).  
- Identify any assets that produce dependencies or provide critical functions for any of the organization’s critical services (NIST ID.BE-4).  
- Create a risk assessment of asset vulnerabilities identified (NIST ID.RA-1, 3).

## Protect
- Create a policy for managing access to authorized devices and resources based on the following items (NIST PR.AC-1).  
- Create a method for controlling physical access to secured assets (NIST PR.AC-2).  
- Create an action plan for informing and training general employees (NIST PR.AT-1).  
- Create a plan for helping privileged users understand their job roles and responsibilities (NIST PR.AT-2).

## Detect
- Which types of systems must be in place to identify occurrences of physical security breaches (NIST DE.CM-2)?  
- Which types of systems must be in place to monitor personnel activity to detect potential cybersecurity threats (NIST DE.CM-3)?

## Respond
- Which type of response plan might be necessary when general physical security is breached at the facility (NIST RS.AN-1, 2, 3)?  
- Considering the information kept on the company’s servers, which type of response plan might be necessary when physical security is breached in the server room (NIST RS.CO-4, 5)?

## Recover
- Which type of recovery plan might be needed for general physical security breaches that occur at one of the cubicles in the facility (NIST RC.RP-1)?  
- Which items might a recovery plan include if server security is breached at the facility (NIST RC.CO-1, 2)?
