- In this section, we will go through a simple machine learning application and create our first model.
  * In the process, we will introduce some core concepts and terms.

Let's assume that a hobby botanist is interested in distinguishing the species of some iris flowers that she has found. She has collected some measurements associated with each iris: the length and width of the petals and the length and width of the sepals, all measured in centimeters.

She also has the measurements of some irises that have been previously identified by an expert botanist as belonging to the species *setosa*, *versicolor*, or *virginica*. For these measurements, she can be certain of which species each iris belongs to. Letâ€™s assume that these are the only species our hobby botanist will encounter in the wild.

Our goal is to build a machine learning model that can learn from the measurements of these irises whose species is known, so that we can predict the species for a new iris.

Because we have measurements for which we know the correct species of iris, this is a supervised learning problem. In this problem, we want to predict one of several options (the species of iris). This is an example of a *classification problem*. The possible outputs (different species of irises) are called *classes*. Every iris in the dataset belongs to one of three classes, so this problem is a three-class classification problem.

The desired output for a single data point (an iris) is the species of this flower. For a particular data point, the species it belongs to is called its *label*.
