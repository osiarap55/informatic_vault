# NumPy

NumPy is one of the fundamental packages for scientific computing in Python, It contains functionality for multidimensional arrays, high level mathematical functions such as linear algebra and fourier tranformations, and pseudorandom number generators.

In *scikit-learn* The NumPy arrays is the fundamentals data structure. *scikit-learn* takes in data in form of NumPy arrays.
The core functionality of Numpy is the *ndarray* class, a multidimensional (multidimensional) array.

```python

import numpy as np

x = np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]])
print("x:\n{}".format(x))
```
